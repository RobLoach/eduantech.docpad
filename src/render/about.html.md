Hi, my name is Eduardo Lávaque (please call me Eduán) and I am a hobby freelancer and I specialize in clean designs and modular code. I've been coding since around 2009 or so, which means I know about the developer world but since I've been switching the language I code in a lot I don't have one language which I'm an expert at.

I am a blogger, an aspiring full stack developer and software engineer, a [Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) advocate, (inactive) moderator for the s2Member forums and an overall thinker. A lot of stuff goes on inside my head every day.

I love Free Software and open source (as long as it's [Free](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)), I also like contributing to Free Software and open source software (when and where I can). I'm always on the lookout for new exciting stuff that's useful.

Right now my focus is on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)[(Script)](http://clojure.org/clojurescript) and [DocPad](http://docpad.org/).

I am a gamer when I can. I'm on [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/greduan/) and on [Desura](http://www.desura.com/members/greduan) and other places that don't matter much.

Now let's check some info about my website:

- It was built using DocPad, the Node.js based static website generator.
- It was then run through some Grunt tasks in order to minify it as much as possible.
- It is being hosted by GitHub Pages.

If you want to contact me for whatever reason please go to my [Contact Me](/contact.html) page.
