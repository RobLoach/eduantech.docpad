If you want or need to contact me you can easily do so by sending an email to my
email account <eduanlavaque@gmail.com>.

If you want to request me as a freelancer please include "Freelancer: " at the
start of the message title. Also please include the following info in your
email:

- Your first and last names.
- The email to which I should send the answer to.
- Your budget, i.e. how much you *can* pay me for this job.
- The description of what you want/need.

Now, the only requirement I have in order for you to hire me as a freelancer is
that you aren't a [Client From Hell](http://clientsfromhell.net/) (no offense).

Another thing, while I can certainly guarantee that my work will be high
quality, I cannot guarantee it'll be done quick, I prefer quality over quantity
in anything and everything, including my work. So keep that in mind.
