This is draft #2 of this post. The first one was way too long so I'm gonna keep it short this time.

First let's get some stuff out of the way. I do not like IE. Never did never will. Don't try to convince me. Maybe if Microsoft didn't make it it would stand a chance in the list of decent browsers.

So if I sound racist towards IE then it's inevitable because I hate it.

## The reasons to drop support for IE8

I don't think anyone really has anything against dropping it. But just in case you're not convinced.

It is old. Really old. It was probably old the day it came out in terms of features.

Doesn't support modern web technologies, at least not without ugly hacks and workarounds. Which should NOT be necessary.

Almost no one uses it anymore. People use IE, but the chances they use IE8 are REALLY low. 6.27% according to the
[W3 Counter](http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php) (at the time of me writing this). IE7 is at 4.59%.

[Google has dropped support for IE8.](http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/supporting-modern-browsers-internet.html) That should say something about this. True they did it because of their "3 latest versions of browser" standard for browser support. But still this should say something about this.

So I hope those are enough reasons. If not think about it this way: The time you spend worrying about old browser support (let's not forget stressing the SHIT out of yourself) you could be making MORE WEBSITES that are useful.

## What would happen?

Let's go to an extreme. What would happen if tomorrow NO websites supported IE8? Chances are nobody would use it. And those few that do use it wouldn't even notice something is wrong. I mean they're using it, that's proof enough they don't care.

## What would be the best way to approach this?

It's really quite simple.

1. DON'T GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO SUPPORT IE.
1. Put a friendly reminder in your website telling the user he's using an old
   version of IE (go ahead and just refer to IE in general if you want) and
   that he really should upgrade to something decent.

Simple as that. And hopefully this post is widely distributed and in a couple of years IE8 is that thing that will be considered amd old and dusty browser in the shelf that nobody uses.
