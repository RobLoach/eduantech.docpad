In this post I'm gonna be going over my personal experience while making a game using Clojure as the language and using an [ECS structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) for the code.

This will not be a "Hey I made Pong!" post. This is a real game that I will develop and eventually (hopefully) make a profit from.

Some things to make clear. I did not know I was going to use Clojure for the language or use an ECS structure for the code. This is what I arrived at after lots of thinking and research.

I'm hoping this post will be of useful insight to those that are considering making game, especially if they're making it using Clojure or the ECS structure.

## Deciding on the language

Of course I didn't wake up and go "Clojure is the way to go." It was several weeks of me considering all the options that I considered fit for my needs.

The languages I considered were Go, C, C++, Common Lisp, JavaScript, Python and a couple of others I think.

So why did I choose Clojure? Several reasons but the most obvious are:

- It's Lisp. Can't argue with that.
- It compiles into JVM bytecode.
- Rich Hickey is smart.

Let's look at the second point.

### It compiles into JVM bytecode

So why is this a selling point?

It means my code is automatically cross platform (as long as the user has Java installed on his computer).

It also means that I have access to all the libraries Java has.

Both of these reasons are big deciding factors. Write my code once with a huge amount of libraries I can use if I wish.

Oh and I also have access to any help users have requested in the past for Java.

## Deciding on the architecture

Once I decided I had to choose between OOP and ECS. This really wasn't really a hard decision.

I just had to understand how both worked pros and cons and stuff. However for me the pros are much better for ECS.

This really came to me listening to my gut. This wasn't a *really* logical decision besides "go with it, you think better with it".

And so far it's been working pretty well. Onto more exciting stuff!

## Learning Clojure

Yes, I decided I wanted to use Clojure before being able to speak in it, deal with it.

This wasn't a bad experience. I'm familiar with the concept of lists and I like it. I'm not uncomfortable with parentheses and brackets either.

I'm also a fast learner so I can learn from guessing the code I'm reading, as long as I know the language basics.

I used [Tim Robinson's Clojure tutorial for beginners](http://blackstag.com/blog.posting?id=5) in order to learn how to read and write Clojure.
